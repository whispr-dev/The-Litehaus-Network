HAVE TO DO TO INSTALL LITEHAUS:::

1. FIREWALL OPEN

```sudo ufw allow 4567/tcp comment 'Litehaus Listener HTTP'
sudo ufw reload```


2. INSTALL NODE 18.x

```sudo apt purge -y nodejs libnode72 libnode-dev
sudo rm -rf /var/cache/apt/archives/nodejs_* /var/lib/apt/lists/*
sudo apt update
url -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
 sudo apt install -y nodejs
sudo apt autoremove -y
node -v
which node```

[then restart and test]



for line endings:

```sed -i 's/\r$//' build-litehaus-packs.sh
chmod +x build-litehaus-packs.sh
./build-litehaus-packs.sh```



for no .zip installer:

```sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y zip unzip```



to create files pre-edit:

```touch filename.txt``` or
```touch one.txt two.txt three.txt``` for multiples; but ofc,
```nano filename.txt``` will auto generate the file if it don't exist.


```> filename.txt``` also creates filename or truncates it to 0 bytes if it already exists.



also:

```echo -n > filename.txt        # creates a truly empty file```
```echo "Hello fren" > note.txt  # creates and writes text```


neat trick:

```truncate -s 0 filename.txt     # empty```
```truncate -s 1M dummy.bin       # 1-megabyte blank binary file```



LOCALLY::

for litehaus installed as a system service, to check is running:

```sudo systemctl status ultimate-lighthouse.service```

should show, like

```Active: active (running) since ...
Main PID: ...
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node /opt/litehaus/server.js```



otherwise start manually:

```sudo systemctl start ultimate-lighthouse.service```



and then watch live logs:

```sudo journalctl -u ultimate-lighthouse.service -f````

shows:

```[INFO] Lighthouse beacon broadcasting on port 6789
[INFO] Sent JSON packet to listener```




```sudo lsof -i :6789```

or

```sudo netstat -tulpen | grep 6789```



REMOTELY::

```sudo nc -u -l -p 6789```

outputs

```{"beacon":"Litehaus-London","timestamp":"2025-10-25T14:31:01Z","load":0.42}```



for TCP:

```sudo nc -l 6789```


if remote and wanna test form another server:

```nc -u <server-ip> 6789```

or curl it:

```curl http://<server-ip>:6789```

or if (HTTPS)

```curl -k https://<domain>:6789```



when using PM2 to manage it:

```cd /opt/litehaus
pm2 logs ultimate-lighthouse```

or

```pm2 monit```



further useful commands:

```sudo systemctl daemon-reload```
```sudo systemctl enable ultimate-lighthouse.service```
```sudo systemctl start ultimate-lighthouse.service```

then

```sudo systemctl status ultimate-lighthouse.service```

to get

```ultimate-lighthouse.service - Ultimate Lighthouse Beacon
   Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/ultimate-lighthouse.service; enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Sat 2025-10-25 20:12:03 UTC; 5s ago
   Main PID: 1234 (node)
   ...``



always useful sanity check:

```ls -l /etc/systemd/system/ultimate-lighthouse.service```


to ensure file exists, if does but still trouble, may have stray `/r` form win newline in which case: 

```sudo sed -i 's/\r$//' /etc/systemd/system/ultimate-lighthouse.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start ultimate-lighthouse.service```


then do

```sudo lsof -i :6789
sudo journalctl -u ultimate-lighthouse.service -f | grep json```



and quick verify file is running:

```sudo systemctl status ultimate-lighthouse.service```

should show:

```Active: active (running)```
